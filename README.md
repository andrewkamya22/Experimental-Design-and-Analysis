# Experimental-Design-and-Analysis
Welcome to my repository dedicated to **statistical projects in experimental design and analysis**, spanning applications from classical agricultural trials to advanced modeling for high-throughput phenotyping and spatially correlated data. These projects draw on work completed during academic coursework, research collaborations, and independent studies.
